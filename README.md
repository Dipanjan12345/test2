## Welcome Once Again!!
Hello Everyone!!:wave:
This is a demo repository which has been created as an initiative to make my friends understand GitHub.

Thanks for the awesome responses in the [Demo Repository(test)](https://github.com/starhasibul/test)
We are on Day 2 of this initiative and today you all need to upload a C Program here.

## Rules for Uploading:--
Give the name of the file as yourname.c . For example, Hasibul.c
On the first line of the program mention the name of program using comment lines.
